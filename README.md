# Alien vs. Zombie

Alien vs zombie is a C++ grid-based game board about aliens fighting with zombies. Users would first put in the number of rows and columns, which would then place alien 'A' in the middle of the board. Random characters would be generated along the board and user will also put in the number of zombies that they want. The alien would have to defeat the zombie by moving around and initiating attacks using commands from user composed of moving up, down, left, right and attacks. The game would be complete if all the zombies are defeated and it would be over if the alien is defeated.
